# Moobo

## Visualize your ideas on moodboards

Use different kind of widgets. Drag, stack, scale or color them.

âš  NOTE: The potential of this app has not yet been reached. At the moment, I consider the program as proof of concept. Unexpected behavior may occur.

### Credits

Moobo is developed after a concept by [Heru Setiawan](https://hrstwn.github.io/). Heru Setiawan is an illustrator who once came up with the idea of an app he called Moobo. The original mockup can be found on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elementaryos/comments/kg5uiw/moobo_is_a_moodboarding_and_notetaking_app/).
